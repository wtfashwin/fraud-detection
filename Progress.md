### 💻 Backend:

* ✔ Preprocessing (`preprocess.py`) ✅
* ✔ Model trained + saved ✅
* ✔ SHAP explainability + plots ✅
* ✔ `deploy.py` running Flask on port 5000 ✅
* ✔ API endpoints responding ✅

### 🧠 AI/ML:

* ✔ Fraud detection model with 97% accuracy ✅
* ✔ SMOTE balancing ✅
* ✔ SHAP insights integrated ✅

### 🖥 Frontend (React + Shadcn + Vite):

* ✔ Project setup with Tailwind, TypeScript, Zustand ✅
* ✔ Dashboard UI with summary cards + charts ✅
* ✔ Latest Transactions table ✅
* ✔ Zustand store (`useAuth`) added ✅

* ⚠️ In progress: full routing + views/pages

## 🎯 Final Goal

> A professional, production-like Fraud Detection Platform:

* With **AI-based insights**
* **End-to-end transaction visibility**
* Auth, alerts, graphs, predictions
* Frontend showing **real dev maturity** with Zustand, Shadcn, Tailwind, clean API usage, modular routing

---

## 🔜 Suggested Next Step:

> 🎯 Start **`Transactions.tsx` + integrate real backend API call**
> Then → add SHAP graph section → auth routes → final deployment.
